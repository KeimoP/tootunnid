- **Password Security**: ✅ bcryptjs with proper salting

### 🔧 Pre-Production Checklist

#### 1. Database Migration (Required)
```bash
# Switch to PostgreSQL for production
npm install @prisma/client prisma
# Update DATABASE_URL in .env.production
# Run migration: npx prisma migrate deploy
```

#### 2. Environment Configuration (Critical)
```bash
# Copy template and configure
cp .env.production.template .env.production

# Generate secure secrets using provided commands
# Replace all default values with production secrets
```

#### 3. Domain & SSL Setup
- Configure HTTPS with valid SSL certificate
- Update NEXTAUTH_URL to production domain
- Set proper CORS origins

#### 4. Monitoring (Recommended)
- Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- Configure logging for production
- Set up uptime monitoring

### 🛡️ Security Features Active

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with cryptographic signature verification
- 7-day token expiration with automatic refresh
- Secure cookie configuration (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- Password hashing with bcryptjs

#### Rate Limiting & Spam Protection
- Per-endpoint rate limiting (login: 5/min, registration: 3/min)
- IP-based request throttling
- Automatic sharing code rotation (every 5 minutes)
- Request size limits and validation

#### Security Headers
- Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection)
- X-Content-Type-Options (MIME sniffing protection)
- Referrer Policy and Permission Policy
