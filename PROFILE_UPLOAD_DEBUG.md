# Profile Picture Upload Test

To test if profile picture upload is working:

1. Open the browser console (F12 -> Console tab)
2. Go to the Profile page
3. Try to upload an image file
4. Check the console for any error messages

Expected console output:
- "Selected file: [filename] [type] [size]"
- "Sending request to /api/user/profile-picture"
- "Response status: 200"
- "Upload successful: [response data]"

If you see errors, they will help identify the issue.

Common issues:
1. File too large (max 5MB)
2. Not an image file
3. Authentication issues
4. Database connection problems
5. File system permissions

Directory structure created:
- public/uploads/profile-pictures/ (for storing uploaded images)
